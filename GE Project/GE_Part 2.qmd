## Read the Data

```{python}
import pandas as pd
from pandas_profiling import ProfileReport
```

```{python}
df = pd.read_csv("D:\School\FL 2022\ISA 401\GE\ge_data.csv")
df.info()
```

## Profile Report

```{python}
profile = ProfileReport(df)
```

```{python}
profile.to_notebook_iframe()
```

## Summary

-   There are no missing values, zero values, or duplicates in the data

-   Variables with constant values hence will be dropped:

    -   `mean_tra`

    -   `mean_t2`

    -   `mean_p2`

    -   `mean_epr`

    -   `mean_farb`

    -   `mean_nf_dmd`

    -   `mean_pcnfr_dmd`

-   Variables that contribute little to no information to the model hence will also be dropped:

    -   `dataset`

    -   `esn`

    -   `unit`

    -   `last_datetime`
-   `mean_p15` has values that are very close to each other that might make it highly correlated with many other variables. I believe this variable could be dropped as it is not so meaningful.
-   `mean_t24` is highly correlated with `operator` and its distribution is quite skewed, so I considered dropping this variable as well.
