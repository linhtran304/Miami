# My projects at Miami University
This repo contains my class projects at Miami as a Business Analytics major.

## GE Project
This is a project from GE Aviation in my *ISA 401: Business Intelligence & Data Visualization* class. The goal of this project is to predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of aircraft gas turbines to help prevent unscheduled maintenance. The project comprises of 5 parts:
- **[Part 1: Data Preparation:](https://linhtran304.github.io/ge_project/GE_Part1)**
    - Merge the datasets and compute any necessary variables
    - Ensure the data is tidy, technically correct, and consistent

- **[Part 2 Data Overview:](https://linhtran304.github.io/ge_project/GE_Part2)** A pandas profiling report to get an overview of the data
- **Part 3: Data Exploration:** An interactive dashboard that allows one to explore the patterns and relationships between the variables
- **[Part 4: Model Building:](https://linhtran304.github.io/ge_project/GE_Part4)** Create a regression model to predict RUL
- **Part 5: Model Deployment:** Deploy the created model using a gradio-based app hosted on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/spaces/linhtran/ge_project)
