# My projects at Miami University
This repo contains my class projects at Miami as a Business Analytics major.

## GE Project
This is a project from GE Aviation in my *ISA 401: Business Intelligence & Data Visualization* class. The goal of this project is to predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of aircraft gas turbines to help prevent unscheduled maintenance. The project comprises of 5 parts:

**1. Data Preparation:**
* Merge the datasets and computed any necessary variables
* Ensure the data is tidy, technically correct, and consistent

**2. Data Overview:** A pandas profiling report to get an overview of the data
**3. Data Exploration:** An interactive dashboard that allows one to explore patterns and relationships between the variables
**4. Model Building:** Create a regression model to predict RUL
**5. Model Deployment:** A gradio-based app hosted on Hugging Face.
